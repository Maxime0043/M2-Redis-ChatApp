# Commands

## Docker Compose

If you want to start the service with Docker Compose, 
you need to build the spa application at `spa/www` and run `npm run build`.
Then, you just have to enter the command `docker compose up` at the root of the project.

## Local

If you want to start the service locally, you will need :

run `npm i`

You can now enter the commands :

> `npm run dev`
